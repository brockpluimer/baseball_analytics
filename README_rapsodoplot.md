Rapsodoplot.R README

Rapsodoplot.R generates a visualization of the average location of different pitch types for an individual pitcher based on 2023 Statcast data. It also calculates the area of the convex hull generated by the vertices (pitches). Essentially, this plot shows how well a pitcher “mixes up” the location of his pitches--the larger the convex hull, the better.

Utility:
1. Performance Analysis: Gain insights into the pitcher's strengths and weaknesses by visualizing the variations in pitch movements.
2. Strategic Planning: Use the visualization for strategizing pitch sequences against specific batters.
3. Player Development: Identify areas for skill improvement or changes in pitching mechanics.
4. Data-Driven Decisions: Make informed decisions using quantitative data, enhancing coaching and player outcomes.
5. Scouting and Recruitment: Understand how a pitcher stacks up in terms of variety and deception in their pitch arsenal.
   
Requirements:
* R environment
* ggplot2 package
* dplyr package
  
Features
1. Data Loading: Automatically reads a CSV file, pitch_movement.csv.
2. Data Filtering: Pre-filters data for a hard-coded pitcher and team, making it easier to zoom in on specific performance.
3. Data Transformation: Cleans and modifies the data for optimum plotting.
4. Color Coding: Custom color themes categorize different pitch types for easier visual interpretation.
5. Convex Hull Calculation: Creates a convex hull around data points to provide a boundary that encloses all pitch types.
6. Custom Plotting: Generates a Rapsodo scatter plot with polygons and custom color themes.
7. Output Handling: Saves the visually rich plot as a PNG file named [Pitcher_Name]_[Team_Name]_Rapsodo_Plot.png.
   
Input Data
A CSV file named pitch_movement.csv should be provided. The file must contain at least the following columns:
* team_name
* name
* pitch_type_name
* pitcher_break_x
* pitcher_break_z
  
Output
* A Rapsodo plot saved as a PNG.
  
How to Run

Place the script in the same folder as pitch_movement.csv. Then execute the script in R or RStudio terminal by running Rscript rapsodoplot.R.

Note, a pitcher must have at least 3 pitch types to generate a hull. Otherwise the plot will only show a single or two points which can still be helpful when evaluating a pitcher’s performance.
